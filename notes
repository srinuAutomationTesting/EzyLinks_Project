About PageObject Model:
..................................
Base class is the parent class of all the classes in which we have written initilaization method and 
inside the constructor we have defind the properties file and we are initialzing the prop variable and driver variable 
the both variables are global variable , in the subclasses we are extending the base class so that we can inherit all 
the properties of baseclass.

scrool top:
window.scrollTo(0,document.body.scrollHeight)

	JavascriptExecutor js = (JavascriptExecutor) driver;
		js.executeScript("window.scrollBy(0,850)", "");
		
		//Hard wait
		
		 WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, 10);
		    WebElement element = wait.until(ExpectedConditions.elementToBeClickable(By.xpath("//button[@id='dropdownMenuButton']")));
		    element.click();
		    
		   
		    //Scrool to top
		    WebElement element = driver.findElement(By.id("id"));
        ((JavascriptExecutor) driver).executeScript("window.scrollTo(document.body.scrollHeight, 0)");
        
        
        
        Action class:
        
        Actions act =  new Actions(driver);
		act.moveToElement(addDriver).build().perform();
	     act.click();
